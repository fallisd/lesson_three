Stanzas

Stanza 1
1  Often rebuked, yet always back returning
2   To those first feelings that were born with me,
3  And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
4   for idle dreams of things that cannot be:

Stanza 2
5  To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
6   Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
7  And visions rising, legion after legion,
8   Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

Stanza 3
9  I’ll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
10   And not in paths of high morality,
11 And not among the half-distinguished faces,
12   The clouded forms of long-past history.

Stanza 4
13 I’ll walk where my own nature would be leading:
14   It vexes me to choose another guide:
15 Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
16   Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.

Stanza 5
17 What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
18   More glory and more grief than I can tell:
19 The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
20   Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell.
    
Emily Bronte
